Hey! I"m ThunderNL, and this is my website, don't expect much from it, but maybe I'll post something sometime.

I'm mostly interested in gaming (I really enjoy playing Stardew Valley and Minecraft).

I'm also interested in all kinds of tech.

If you ever need one of my socials you can find them [here](https://thunder.nl.eu.org/links/).
